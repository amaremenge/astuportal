In addition to producing useful materials, Chemical Engineering is also concerned with investigating valuable materials and techniques which contribute to dynamic Research & Development world. Chemical Engineering, therefore, focuses on various processes that cause chemical, physical, biological, energy content changes in addition to designing and inventing the way to do so. Sustainable development can be realized by having profitable, efficient and environmentally friendly industries. In relation to this, Chemical Engineering has a great contribution in the area of Design, Operations, Control, Optimization & Modification of processes and plants. The profession is needed for the conception, creation (design), operation, control, optimization, and improvement of the process industries. Examples of products that are the results of the works of chemical engineers include various chemicals, petrochemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals and other medicines, agrochemicals, processed foods, energy (fuels, nuclear energy, others), pulp and paper, beverages, cement, ceramics, and many others. It is the chemical engineer who is responsible for conceiving (product, process, and equipment), designing, operating, controlling, optimizing, and improving (modifying and modernizing) the industries that produce the aforementioned products and myriads of others."
