These reconfigurable computers can be quickly customized at the hardware level to perform exactly the computation required in hardware, overcoming the fixed hardware configurations found in many contemporary microprocessors. In this class, we investigate the state-of-the-art in reconfigurable computing both from a hardware and software perspective. The desire to efficiently solve important problems drives reconfigurable computing. Consequently, throughout this class we will discuss several numeric and signal processing applications and the characteristics that make them attractive to reconfigurable computing platforms. Initially, we review in detail the basic building blocks of most reconfigurable computers, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The characteristics of FPGA VLSI architecture such as the organization of device logic and interconnection resources are examined to quantify hardware limitations. These physical limitations are then contrasted with computer-aided design issues such as the selection of circuit component locations in devices (the placement problem) and subsequent circuit interconnection between components (the routing problem). While discrete FPGA devices offer an abundance of usable logic, most current reconfigurable computing applications require hardware configurations of multiple FPGAs and memory components organized in a computing system. As a final step, we focus on the architecture for existing multi-FPGA systems and on compilation techniques for mapping applications described in a hardware description language to reconfigurable hardware. Specific contemporary reconfigurable computing systems are examined to identify existing system limitations and to highlight opportunities for research.
